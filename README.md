# Odin Project: Recipes

## Introduction:
This project will walk me through how to build a basic recipe website. Its purpose is to lay the foundations of HTML. Stylization will happen later when I learn about CSS.

This project will also get more acquainted with using GitHub from the Command Line.

## Reflection:
### 03.21.2023
- Thought more about utilizing containers for everything I layout on a website
- Worked more with Flex; getting more accustomed, but still not an expert
#### To-do
- Need to format layout for individual recipe pages
#### Problems
- Can't seem to figure out why the recipe-cards wrap in an odd way for responsiveness

### 03.22.2023
- I am wanting to try to see if there was a way to make one html page and utilize javascript to insert text into the html tags.
    - Try substituting text
        -Had trouble inserting array text into li element *fixed*
        -Having trouble figuring logic to substitute a background image *fixed*
    - onclick events
        - Trouble with duplication on overlay when clicking on item multiple times *fixed*
        - Above fix causes lag on hideOverlay() 
-Trying to attach title and description from recipe-page to recipe-cards
    -Problems with substituting items in overlay (Look into loops?)
- Made an overlay effect with the recipe-page contents
