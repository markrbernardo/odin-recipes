# Odin Project: Recipes

## Introduction:
This project will walk me through how to build a basic recipe website. Its purpose is to lay the foundations of HTML. Stylization will happen later when I learn about CSS.

This project will also get more acquainted with using GitHub from the Command Line.

## Reflection:
### 03.21.2023
- Thought more about utilizing containers for everything I layout on a website
- Worked more with Flex; getting more accustomed, but still not an expert
#### To-do
- Need to format layout for individual recipe pages
#### Problems
- Can't seem to figure out why the recipe-cards wrap in an odd way for responsiveness
